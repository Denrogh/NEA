# NEA
Code for my A-level AQA Computer Science 2020

My project is a python based teaching tool for teaching A-level students about the tree traversal algorithms and about postfix and infix conversion and allowing them to convert between them. 

The program consists of 4 files. database.py contains all the database functionality, this includes adding and remomving questions and giving each user their own statistics. tree.py contains the classes used to generate the visual trees. conversion.py contains all the conversion algorithms and the checking processes . gui.py is the main file which provides the graphical interface in pygame and loads all the features. 

The program features GUI classes.This includes Pygame Input Box, Pygame Button, Pygame Tree/Pygame Binary Search Tree. If you are using this as a 'reference' for your own NEA project, then good luck! Feel free to drop me an email devonconnor321@gmail.com and I will help any way I can.
