Code for my A-level AQA Computer Science 2020

My project is a python based teaching tool for teaching A-level students about the tree traversal algorithms and about postfix and infix conversion and allowing them to convert between them

The program consists of 4 files. database.py contains all the database functionality, this includes adding and remomving questions and giving each user their own statistics. tree.py contains the classes used to generate the visual trees. conversion.py contains all the conversion algorithms and the checking processes . gui.py is the main file which provides the graphical interface in pygame and loads all the features.
